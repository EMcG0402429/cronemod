IF YOU FIND BROKEN SHIT, POST AN ISSUE: https://github.com/EMcG0402429/cronemod/issues
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changelog
---------
Version 1.07
------------
- Mechanical Militia halved Gemcost, moved to Const 5
- Removed better Paralyze from Lemuria freespawn, left it on Shadow Tribunes though. Too good for stuff that massable.
- Lemurian rare freespawn (Principes and Praetorians) made Sacred, because it is weird that Lemuria has zero Sacred troops. Still not massable or hugely significant, but makes them a bit beefier as bodyguards, at least.

Version 1.06b
-------------
-Fixed stupid mistake with new Lemuria weapons

Version 1.06
------------
- Shinuyama adjustments
-- Made Bandits forestrecruit
-- Reduced recruitment age of Bakemono Sorcerors (still start in old age, but MUCH LESS old age)
-- Removed upkeep cost of summoned Oni (this also affects Jomon)

Version 1.05a
-------------
- Fixed a stupid bug in the new EA Anathemant Basilisk which was causing them to be an Agarthan hero instead of a Salamander.

Version 1.05
------------
- Code refactored, commented, and categorized
- Undid crossbow changes in light of armour being better anyway
- Burden of Time is now Thaum 6
- Some other minor things I fixed in passing. Fuck. I don't know anymore. I've been sitting here staring at this fucking thing for four hours.
- Lemuria unfucked: Reduced siege defence of freespawn. Added AP to their MR Negates weapons. Changed starting commanders to include a D2 caster, and reduced Revive Lemur Thaumaturg to D2 to cast.
- Crossbow resource cost increased
- Hats for Living Pillars to go with their resource cost reduction
- Abysia gets caverecruit fire/earth casters, and the Annointed of Rhuuax have their path variety increased.
